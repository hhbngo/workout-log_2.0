## About The Project
### Motivation
This project was primary made to practice and improve at Typescript. I use this application daily and realized the previous version had many flaws and bugs. In this version I completely redesign the UI to be more appealing to use. A new data visualization feature was added. I did my best to 
optimize the app using hooks and best practices throughout development.
